# BASIC SIMPLE CALCULATOR

## APP SUMMARY


The style.css file defines the visual appearance of a calculator application. It centers the calculator on the page with a dark background and styles the display area with a distinct font, color scheme, and alignment for readability. Buttons are arranged in a responsive grid layout with defined sizes, colors, and hover effects to enhance user interaction. Meanwhile, script.js handles the calculator's functionality, including number input, arithmetic operations, and display updates. Together with index.html, which structures the calculator interface and integrates external styling and scripting, the code creates a cohesive and functional calculator experience for users.

## LEARNING UPDATE

This is all new to me but I find it fascinating that there is endless possibilities on what you can make your code do.
It is always fun to play around with the coloring in CSS.  HTML is equally fun too. I haven't dived deep into Javascript yet because there is so much to study but one thing I can tell is that it is a hard language to learn but will be the most rewarding in the end. The most satisfying feeling is seeing what happens in my chrome browser as I code. It's one of the parts am always looking forward to.
Javascript felt like i was learning a totally new language that is not English but now, I can strongly say I am far better than when I started coding.
